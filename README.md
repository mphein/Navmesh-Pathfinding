Navmesh Pathfinding 

This project implements in Python a bidirectional A* search algorithm to solve the problem of finding paths in navmeshes created from user-provided images.

Two points are selected on these user provided images and a path is found between them based on which pathfinding algorithm is preferred. Sucecesfully implemented using segments and paths from the start point to the destination point. Implemented Breadth First Search, Djikstra's, A*, and bidirectional A* pathfinding algorithms.

Examples are provided in the results folder depicting the navigational mesh, paths explored, and the minimal cost path found with the algorithm. Can be used for AI pathing and decision making in games.

Challenges faced: Learning the various differences between above named algorithms. Using data structures to track segments, costs, and paths explored.
Learned: Djikstra's Algorithm, A*, bidirectional A* implementation in Python. Use cases for pathfinding. Differences between each pathfinding algorithm and when you might want to use each one.
